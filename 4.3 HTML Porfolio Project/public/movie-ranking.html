<h1>The Best Movies According to Alif</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>COCO</h3>
<p>COCO is my favourite computer-animated fantasy movie. The struggle of coco to pursue his<br> dream of music and singing despite of being in a family where music is ban and their family history. <br>The comic timming, the hush and rush of coco to sing, the horror part excites me. </p>

<h3>Ranjhanaa</h3>
<p>Ranjhanaa is my favourite romantic drama film. The plot, the dailouges are very souful.</p>

<h3>Baghban</h3>
<p>A film with which i have a beautiful memory and incident of childhood.</p>
